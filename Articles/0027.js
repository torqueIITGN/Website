Our AI algorithm helps diagnose 67 skin conditions, while our platform helps patients connect with certified dermatologists with a click.<br><br>We knew our idea had potential when our first investor invested just looking at our prototype. On the day of receiving our first tranche of funding, lockdown was imposed. Our life changed. The financial crunch made fund raising amid pandemic impossible. The slow flow of funding meant every business decision needed multiple checks and balances for recruiting talent, building the most accurate AI model and onboarding dermatologists. One of our core values is transparency, so we shared the honest account of our funding status with the employees. Changing the business model from booking appointments to delivering online consultations was the need of the hour. Rather than treating them as mere employees, we treated them as stakeholders to turn the tide. With trust and patience, we rekindled the hope in our employees who went beyond the call of duty to build DermaLens, India&rsquo;s first AI based skin diseases diagnosis app. Looking at our app, the investors felt confident to invest in us. The funding has given impetus to our goal of onboarding 2500 dermatologists in two years and catering to 500K patients.<br><br>Through this audacious journey, during the pandemic, we learned that our employees are the most important asset. We are always looking for people who are passionate about changing the world. Join us in our journey, making skin care accessible and affordable.

The company focusses on bringing man-machine integration in the construction segment, using its state of the art 3D concrete printing technology. 3D concrete printing is a novel method which uses fully automated concrete extrusion assembly to perform layer-wise construction of large scale segments. The process results in quality-compliant end products with better control over the rheology and finish of the material. Further, 3D concrete printing is more sustainable and eco-friendly, as it produces 40% less carbon foot print compared to the conventional methods. Besides, the major commercial challenges associated with conventional construction such as cost and time are also effectively addressed using this technology.<br>The founders of MiCoB have been working on the different aspects of 3D concrete printing technology viz. prototype development, development of in-house, large scale 3D printer, design of optimum concrete mix for printing, and incorporation of novel techniques of improvement of output quality. The successful results has motivated the co-founders to implement this technology for rapid construction in large scale housing projects.<br><br>Beating the blues:<br><br>&ldquo;Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.&rdquo;<br>-Charles R Swindoll<br><br>By the end of 2019, with a well-motivated team, an investment about to close, and a finalised factory site, the company was all set to launch big. However, some microbes in the universe planned to retaliate to this plan of ours. Just before a week of site inauguration, national lock down got announced. Consequently, investments went on hold, cash flow got stagnated and the plans were being shattered. After a month of nothingness and prevailing uncertainties, it was then that the team decided to utilise this time for some good. So planners were re- opened and once again the brain storming started. After some iterations in the plan we finally decided to act with baby steps rather than waiting for going big at once. With the support from IIEC, grants from Govt. of Gujarat, and our continuous perseverance, we were ready with our own in-house 3D concrete printer, in less than 45 days. It is note-worthy that we started from the scratch and all the assemblies, software development and system integrations were performed in-house, without any external or outsourced professional technical support.<br><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"> <img class="para-img" src="../Assets/27D.png"></div> <div class="col-md-6"> <img class="para-img" src="../Assets/27E.png"></div></div>3D concrete printing facility developed by MiCob at IIT Gandhinagar<br><br>Due to financial constraints, the developed 3D printer was indeed smaller and limited in its capabilities as compared to our initial plan. Further, due to market slow-down, entering the construction business was near-impossible challenge. Thus, after a thorough market analysis, we decided to firstly enter in the niche market of premium concrete furniture. With its modern and minimalistic look, unique designs and high ease of customisation, we believe MiCoB&rsquo;s concrete furniture would be an excellent choice for the modern d&eacute;cor. Other salient features of our furniture include its long-term durability, low maintenance, no swelling, and resistance to heat, extreme weather conditions, microbial attacks and termites. The company has been successful in delivering its first furniture range (called Legacy) to various independent clients as well as to our esteemed institute (IITGN), and have received very encouraging feedbacks. However, there are still technical and marketing challenges that we are in process to address.<br><img class="para-img" src="../Assets/27F.png" style="margin-left:20% !important; margin-right:20% !important; width: 60% !important;"><br>And the silver lining<br><br>While the company had gained the momentum with the furniture business, we still felt attached to our very core idea of making significant contribution to the society. In Nov 2020, we were fortunate to get that opportunity, when the senior personnel of Indian defence visited our facility at IITGN. Impressed with our state of the art facility, they spread the word with in their organisation, and after several meetings we finally got the honour to demonstrate our technology and the contributions that we could make in the defence sector. After receiving a very positive feedback, currently, the company is working on developing effective and mobile defensive military fortifications and construction of shelters and habitats for Indian defence.<br><img class="para-img" src="../Assets/27G.jpg"><br>In a more recent project, the company developed a 3D printed, rapid-construction, habitat structure, to showcase the applicability of our technology in mass housing construction in India. Apart from safe, modular and rapid construction, other key features of our 3D concrete printed structures would include 70% less material consumption, reduced carbon foot print, reduced HVAC load, and better thermal comfort.<br><img class="para-img" src="../Assets/27H.png"><br>In a nutshell<br><br>With our humble beginning, perseverance and a constant support from our mentors, we look forward to make some significant contribution to the society. With the vision to improve the current scenario of architecture, infrastructure and real estate , MiCoB looks forward to offer design freedom, streamlined construction processes, economic habitats to all and sustainable infrastructure; while also making the due contribution in safeguarding the environment. In a nutshell, we at MiCoB aims to be a part of the society that thrives to create a better world for the upcoming generation.<br>Together, let us create a better tomorrow! <br><br>Let&rsquo;s print the future!<br><img class="para-img" src="../Assets/27C.png">Founders, MiCoB<br>Reach us at <a href="mailto:ankita@micob.in">ankita@micob.in</a><br>Mobile: +91 878 037 9232<br>Website:<a href="https://micob.in/">https://micob.in/</a><br>Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MicobPvtLtd">https://www.facebook.com/MicobPvtLtd</a><br>Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/micob_india">https://www.instagram.com/micob_india</a><br>Linkedin: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/micob-pvt-ltd">https://www.linkedin.com/company/micob-pvt-ltd</a>', 'twitterShare': 'https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=URL_HERE&text=Check out this article from Torque:', 'fbShare': 'https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=URL_HERE', 'prevArticle': '0026.html', 'articleNo': '0027', 'nextArticle': '0028.html'};
